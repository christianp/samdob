        <h1>SAMDOB - Explanation</h1>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>Pretty much everyone is taught a mnemonic for the order of arithmetic operations.</p>
        <p>Some people are taught BODMAS, some are taught BIMDAS, while PEMDAS is popular in other parts of the world.</p>
        <p>They describe the order in which you should carry out operations, but you need some more rules as well, that don't fit into a snappy mnemonic:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Consider each operation in turn, reading the mnemonic from left to right.</li>
            <li>Read the expression from left to right. When you encounter the current operation, replace it with its numerical result.</li>
            <li>When you get to the end of the expression, go back to the start and move to the next operation in the mnemonic.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Except</strong> multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction, have the same precedence: you consider them both at the same time, rather than one after the other. The mnemonic doesn't mention this.</p>
        <p>It's actually quite fiddly, but the fiddliness rarely makes a difference, if you've got common sense.</p>
        <p><em>What if you didn't have any common sense?</em></p>

        <h2>So</h2>
        <p>SAMDOB lets you see how the order of operations is applied. When you write an expression in the right-hand box, the steps taken to evaluate it to a number are shown underneath.</p>
        <p>You can change the order of operations by writing a mnemonic in the left-hand box. Once you've done that, the sequence is described underneath.</p>
        <p>Letters grouped in brackets have the same precedence.</p>
        <p>Not every letter stands for a real operation. Don't worry about it.</p>
